def train_model(train_data, train_labels, test_data, test_labels, model):

    Trains given model using provided training data and labels.

    Training includes:
    - Early stopping to prevent overfitting.
    - Validation on test dataset.
    - Configurable training parameters (epochs, batch size) from CONFIG.

    Parameters:
        train_data (numpy.ndarray): Training features.
        train_labels (numpy.ndarray): Training labels.
        test_data (numpy.ndarray): Testing features.
        test_labels (numpy.ndarray): Testing labels.
        model (tf.keras.Model): The model to train.

    Returns:
        tuple:
            - model (tf.keras.Model): The trained model.
            - history (tf.keras.callbacks.History): Training history containing loss and accuracy metrics.
